- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
-   I think inheritance is a bit confusing, I feel as if each building can work on its own without needing the name, address, and floors of the building. I understand the idea but in terms of code its a bit hard to see.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
        I used to go to TA hours everytime and would just sit there if I didn't get it. Once we searched in the Java documentation I remembered that we can google things. For basic questions someone taking this course should try to search for things first.
